<!-- Create an array containing the names of the 12 months of the year - “January” through “December”.
Create a function called getMonthName that takes a single number as a parameter and returns the
name of that month. For example:
console.log(getMonth(3)); // this should log “March”
Remember that arrays are indexed starting with 0, but here, month 1 should be January. So you’ll
have to account for that somehow. -->
